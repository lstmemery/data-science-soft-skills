## Why did your employer hire you?


<aside class="notes">
 - They hired you because they have problems that they think you can solve
 - When you get hired you realize that the biggest problems are the ones they couldn't even recognize!
</aside>

## How do get better at solving problems?

   $$Effort * Time = Productivity$$

(Cal Newport)

<aside class ="notes">
 - This is the only LaTeX in this presentation
 - This comes from Deep Work
 - Think about how long you were able to work on a project without losing focus
 - Your goal should be maximize that amount of time
</aside>

## Optimizing for Effort

 1. Sleep
 2. Diet
 3. Exercise

<aside class="notes">
 - If you aren't sleeping, eating well or exercising regularly, you won't have much energy
 - Trying to push yourself without taking of your yourself
 - Know when to stop for the day without feeling guilty about it (For me it's 5 hours of deep work or 6pm)
 - I used to be very bad at this in university
</aside>


## Optimizing for Time

 1. Track (time)
 2. Remove (distractions)
 3. Automate (the boring stuff)

<aside class = "notes">
 - First, start tracking your time (I use 30 minute increments)
 - Remove everything from your phone that distracts you (even your work Slack)
 - Automate whatever you can
</aside> 

## The Pomodoro Method

 1. Work on one thing for 25 minutes.
 2. Rest for 5 minutes.
 3. Repeat 4 times.
 4. Take a longer break.

## Distractions

## What should I automate?

<aside class = "notes">
 - Think about the tasks you do when you had a bad night's rest (low effort)
 - Bonus points if it's something that a lot of your co-workers complain about
</aside>

## What about meetings?

<aside class = "notes">
 - If you are invited to a meeting, ask for an agenda. Come prepared and arrive on time.
 - Try to minimize the number of people in meetings to just stakeholders
 - If someone is checking their emails for most of the meeting, then the meeting should have been an email
</aside>

## Planning

<aside class="note">
 - Humans are very bad it this
 - Hope you've been tracking your time!
 - My rule of thumb: break a project into small tasks (should take 2 to 4 hours to complete) then double your gut feeling on tasks you haven't tracked before
</aside>

## Why are you here?

 - You were hired because you have skills that your employer does not have
 

<aside class="notes">
 - Don't assume that anyone else knows what you are talking about
 - Others may not understand your value until you show it
</notes>


## Data science and data engineering

 - You will likely see both types of projects in your career
 - **Data science:** You are attempting to predict or explain something
 - **Data engineering:** You are supporting a data science project by making data or results more accessible to others


## Data engineering projects

 - Usually instrastructure projects
 - These projects are more complicated than you expect with a lot of buy-in
 

## Common Data Engineering Pitfalls

 - Don't overengineer: The people who use your work don't care about the tech stack


## Data science projects

 - There is no guarentee that what you are trying will work


## Common Data Science Pitfalls

 - You don't have the data to answer the question
 - You spent too much time polishing a model of little value
 - Bugs in data science projects are hard to find and squash


## Planning
 - Assume that something will go wrong
 - Be clear of your project's trade-offs 

 
## Personal Productivity

 - I use the Pomodoro technique
 - Spend 25 minutes do a single thing without looking at your phone
 - Rest for 5 minutes


## Setting Expectations

 - Planning software is extremely difficult
 - Planning machine learning is even harder

## Minimize Meetings

 - Talk to your manager
 - Demand an agenda before accepting a meeting
 - Block off parts of your calendar for work


## Leave Time to Learn

 - I take at least an hour a day to learn something new
 - You are investing in your future
